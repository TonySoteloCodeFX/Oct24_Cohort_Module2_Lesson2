<h1>Module 2 Lesson 2: The Magic of Conditional Statements: Assignments: Dive Deeper</h1>
<hr>

<h3>1. Decisions at the Crossroad</h3>

<h5>Task 1: Code Correction</h5> You are provided with a Python script that uses conditional statements to tell if a number is positive, negative, or zero, but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

<h5>Buggy Code:</h5>

```
number = input("Enter a number: ")

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number = 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
```

<h3>2. The Greatest Showdown</h3>

<h5>Task 1: Identify the Greatest</h5> Write a Python program that asks the user to enter three numbers. Your code should then identify and print out the largest number among the three.

<h5>Task 2: Identify the Smallest</h5> Improve upon your code from Task 1 to also determine the smallest number among the three and print it out.

<h6>Expected Outcome:</h6> If we provide the numbers 3, 3, and 4, it should print out that "The smallest number is 3. The largest number is 4. "

<h3>3. Leap Year Explorer</h3>

<h5>Task 1: Leap Year Checker</h5> Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year. The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

<h6>Expected Outcome:</h6> If you test the year 1900, is should be False. The year 2000 should be True. The year 2024 should be True

<h6>NOTE:</h6> Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements or print statements they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
